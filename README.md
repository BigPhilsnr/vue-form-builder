to get both of GUI & Template working normally.

## Form Builder Structure
- Template: is where you can config/create/edit your own form.

## How to install?
Run this command to install:
```php
npm i v-form-builder --save
```

NPMJS: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/v-form-builder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/v-form-builder)

**Notes:** 
- For the best experience, please install the latest version!
- Please don't install the old version below **v1.1.1**. Thank you!

## How to implement?

### Import into your project
1/ Import as global component
```javascript
import FormBuilder from 'v-form-builder';
Vue.component('FormBuilder', FormBuilder);
```

2/ Import as single component
```javascript
import FormBuilder from 'v-form-builder';

export default {
    components: {FormBuilder}
    ...
}
```

**Note:** you should have your own Bootstrap 4 stylesheet imported inside your project in order to use the Form Builder normally.

### Usage
```php
<template>
    <div>
        // form builder template
        <form-builder type="template"></form-builder>
        
        // form builder gui
        <form-builder type="gui" :form="yourConfigFormObject"></form-builder>
    </div>
</template>
```
Binding options:
- type (String):
    - Form Config (Template): **template**
    - Form GUI: **gui**
- form (Object) - for Form GUI Only, where you passing the configuration data and the Form Builder will build the form by your configuration data.

#### V-Model for Form Builder Template
You can use v-model in Form Builder Template, it'll return to you the form configuration data that you're configurated (object) and also render the old configuration and let you edit/update that configuration.
```php
<template>
    <div>
        <form-builder type="template" v-model="formData"></form-builder>
    </div>
</template>
```
The form config data would look like this:
```javascript
{
    sections: [...],
    layout: "...",
    _uniqueId: "..."
}
```

Ideally, you need to convert that Object to JSON string and then save it in your database :D

#### V-Model for Form Builder GUI
You can use V-Model to get/set values from your built form.
```php
<template>
    <div>
        <form-builder type="gui" :form="formData" v-model="formValues"></form-builder>
    </div>
</template>
```
The form values data would look like this:
```javascript
{
    section_key: {
        control_name_1: "data",
        control_name_2: 123,
        ...
    },
    ...
}
```
